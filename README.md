# Wifi Password Cracker

## Author - Francesco Dore ( @FranzDore on GitHub )

The following code was written as a way to improve my Python skills. The following program, when executed on a computer, generates a new file in the same directory as the program, inside of which all the device's saved wifi names and passwords will be displayed (if possible).
Usage of the following program is free for whoever feels like modifying it or using it.
## Usage of the program
You'll find a Python code and a ".exe" file:
* The Python program can only be executed if Python is installed on the computer (Source Code is found in the .py file)
* The .exe file, that can be executed even without having Python installed on the machine.

All you gotta do is download the .exe file and run it on the desired machine.
